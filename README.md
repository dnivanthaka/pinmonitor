# pinmonitor
Pin status monitoring service/daemon for Raspberry pi.

- A list of pins to be monitored has to be supplied as a .conf file. All the designated pins would be set as input and would be monitored for status changes.
- All state changes would be sent to the respective script that is specified in the .conf file along with the read value as a parameter. For E.g. sample.py 1
- Must be run as sudo

### Builiding/Compiling and Running
- Clone this repository and issue "make"
- Run as "sudo ./pinmon"

### Stopping the service [For now]
- find the process id of the pinmon service by executing "ps aux | grep pinmon"
and kill it by issuing "sudo kill [process id]"

#### TODO
- Improve the performance by using memory mapped IO
